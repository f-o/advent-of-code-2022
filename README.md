# Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree:

This repo contains my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code, written in Python.

The AoC is a series of daily programming challenges, available at: https://adventofcode.com/


## Usage

To run the solutions, you'll need Python 3.9 or later.

Each day's challenge is in a separate folder, named `Day_XX`, where `XX` is the day number zero-padded to two digits.

The folder contains:

- `challenge.md`, which contains the challenge description
- `input_sample.txt`, which contains the sample input data for the challenge (if any)
- `input.txt`, which contains the input data for the challenge
- `day_XX.py`, which contains both parts of the solution for the challenge

To run the solution for a given day, run the `day_XX.py` file:

```bash
python3 day_XX.py
```

The solution will be printed to the console.
